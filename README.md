# Rusty Spaced Repetition

(thanks to Blueraja at http://www.blueraja.com/blog/477/a-better-spaced-repetition-learning-algorithm-sm2 for the discussion and pseudocode)

## Goals

The high level goal is to spread the use of spaced repetition as far and wide as possible so those who choose to can positively direct their lifelong memory and (hopefully) help create a more creative and thoughtful world. The subgoals to achieve this are:

* provide an implementation of SM2 that is safe (Rust) and portable (WASM)
* provide an easy method for adding simple spaced-repetition functionality to your article/game/website
**    design and implement a DSL for flashcard generation
**    provide a small embeddable SDK for using HTML div tags to insert spaced repetition cards in your article/game/website
